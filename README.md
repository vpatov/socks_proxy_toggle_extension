For installing the extension, you can follow the instructions here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing

Since this extension uses the "proxy" API (in order to toggle socks5), it needs to have permission to run in incognito windows, so be sure to enable that on the extension settings after installing the extension.
